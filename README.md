# PresidentQuiz
Built with python [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html) (built-in CLI library), no dependency installation required

## Installation + Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StephenXie/PresidentQuiz.git

```

## How to play
Type the names(last name only works) of the U.S. Presidents(not necessarily in order, but recommended) in the textbox in the terminal
Type "quit" to exit the game
